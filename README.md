# Ticketmaster take-home challenge[^1]

I chose to implement the user story ["inform the fan if they're already on the waiting list when the form loads"](https://github.com/joe-dev-public/fac-ticketmaster-take-home-challenge/issues/9).

View the deployed challenge on GitHub Pages here: https://joe-dev-public.github.io/fac-ticketmaster-take-home-challenge/

## How to use

- [Open the challenge](https://joe-dev-public.github.io/fac-ticketmaster-take-home-challenge/).
- Click a button to run the challenge:
  - One button loads a user who's already on the waiting list; the other one who isn't.
  - When the button is clicked, it's as if the user has just successfully logged in.
- There's a small delay as the page simulates waiting for an API response.
- If the user is already on the waiting list, they're informed of this with a message.
- If the user isn't already on the waiting list, then the form to join the waiting list is loaded.
- You can reload the page to pick a different user.
